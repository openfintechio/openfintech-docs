**Description:** 
 
: [EN] Litepay is a digital payment solution developed to facilitate fast, secure, and user-friendly transactions using cryptocurrencies, with a particular focus on Litecoin. Originally introduced as a platform that would allow merchants to accept Litecoin payments and instantly convert them to fiat currencies, Litepay aimed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital currencies. Although the original Litepay project was discontinued shortly after its launch, various services and providers have since adopted similar names to offer crypto payment processing, wallet services, and merchant tools, often emphasizing low transaction fees and global accessibility. Depending on the current iteration or entity operating under the Litepay name, the core objective remains simplifying the acceptance of crypto payments for online businesses. Litepay and 500+ other payment providers are already integrated into Corefy’s payment orchestration platform, allowing our clients to start using the integration instantly without coding by simply entering their MID credentials in Corefy’s dashboard.
