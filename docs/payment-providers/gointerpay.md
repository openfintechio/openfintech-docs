The platform is particularly beneficial for merchants targeting Latin America, Asia, and other underbanked regions, offering features like real-time currency conversion, fraud management, and full compliance with local regulations. This and 500+ providers are already integrated to Corefy’s payment orchestration platform, allowing our clients to start using the integration instantly without coding by simply entering their MID credentials in Corefy’s dashboard.
