**Description:** 
 
: [EN] ePro is a payment solution developed by SafeCharge (now part of Nuvei) that facilitates alternative payment processing for online merchants, particularly in high-risk industries such as iGaming, digital content, and forex. ePro functions as a localized deposit method that allows users to fund their accounts through familiar and trusted local banking systems or vouchers, improving conversion rates and user experience in regions where card usage is limited or where users prefer alternative payment channels. The system is built to be compliant, secure, and easy to integrate, offering merchants a way to expand their reach and support local preferences without operational complexity. ePro and 500+ other payment providers are already integrated into Corefy’s payment orchestration platform, allowing our clients to start using the integration instantly without coding by simply entering their MID credentials in Corefy’s dashboard.
