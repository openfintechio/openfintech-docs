**Description:** 
 
: [EN] CDN (Cash Discount Network) is a payment method and processing model that allows merchants to offer customers a discount for paying with cash or cash-equivalent methods, such as debit cards or ACH, instead of credit cards. The primary goal of CDN is to help businesses offset high credit card processing fees by encouraging lower-cost payment options. With this setup, customers who choose to pay with a credit card cover the processing fee as part of the purchase price, while those who pay with cash or debit receive a discount equivalent to that fee. This approach is particularly popular among small businesses and service providers aiming to reduce operational costs while remaining compliant with card network rules and regulations.
