:	[RU] PayID 
 
**Description:** 
 
: [EN] Pay ID is a real-time payment method developed for the New Payments Platform (NPP) in Australia, designed to simplify the process of sending and receiving money using easy-to-remember identifiers instead of traditional bank account numbers. Users can link a Pay ID—such as a mobile number, email address, or ABN—to their bank account, enabling fast, secure, and near-instant transfers 24/7. Widely adopted by Australian banks and financial institutions, Pay ID enhances user experience by making payments more accessible and reducing input errors. It is particularly useful for peer-to-peer transfers, bill payments, and business transactions, offering the benefits of real-time confirmation, strong security standards, and compatibility with mobile banking apps.
